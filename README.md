_printf
This project implements the _printf function, which is a simple version of the printf function found in the C programming language. The _printf function can be used to print characters, strings, integers, and decimals (base 10).

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed:

A C compiler
A text editor
Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/KelvinTichana-creator/printf.git


## Compiling and Running

To compile the project, you can use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -o _printf _printf.c

This will create an executable file called _printf. To run the project, you can use the following command:

./_printf

This will print a help message that shows the different format specifiers that the _printf function supports.

Format Specifiers
The _printf function supports the following format specifiers:

%c - Print a character.
%s - Print a string.
%d - Print an integer.
%x - Print an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format.
%o - Print an unsigned integer in octal format.
%u - Print an unsigned integer in decimal format.
%r - Print a string in reverse order.
%p - Print a pointer address.
Example
The following code shows an example of how to use the _printf function:

int main() {
int i = 10;
char str[] = "Hello, world!";

_printf("This is a test: %d %s\n", i, str);

return 0;
}


This code will print the following output:

This is a test: 10 Hello, world!

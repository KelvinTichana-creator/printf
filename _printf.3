_printf

NAME

_printf - custom printf function

SYNOPSIS

#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION

_printf is a custom printf function that is similar to the printf function from the stdio.h library. It supports the following specifiers:

d or i: Prints the value of an integer as a decimal number.
c: Prints the value of a character as a character.
s: Prints the value of a string as a string.
%: Prints a literal % character.
b: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as a binary number.
x or X: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as a hexadecimal number.
o: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as an octal number.
u: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as an unsigned decimal number.
r: Prints the value of a string in reverse order.
p: Prints the address of a pointer as a hexadecimal number.
Arguments

The arguments that you pass to _printf() are the values that you want to print. The arguments can be of any type, including integers, characters, strings, and pointers.

Format string

The format string is a string that tells _printf how to format the output. The format string can contain any of the following characters:

%: Indicates the start of a format specifier.
d or i: Prints the value of an integer as a decimal number.
c: Prints the value of a character as a character.
s: Prints the value of a string as a string.
%: Prints a literal % character.
b: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as a binary number.
x or X: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as a hexadecimal number.
o: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as an octal number.
u: Prints the value of an unsigned integer as an unsigned decimal number.
r: Prints the value of a string in reverse order.
p: Prints the address of a pointer as a hexadecimal number.
Specifiers

The following are the specifiers that are supported by _printf():

d or i
Prints the value of an integer as a decimal number.

c
Prints the value of a character as a character.

s
Prints the value of a string as a string.

%
Prints a literal % character.

b
Prints the value of an unsigned integer as a binary number.

x or X
Prints the value of an unsigned integer as a hexadecimal number.

o
Prints the value of an unsigned integer as an octal number.

u
Prints the value of an unsigned integer as an unsigned decimal number.

r
Prints the value of a string in reverse order.

p
Prints the address of a pointer as a hexadecimal number.

Examples

The following code would print the value of the integer variable x as a decimal number:

c
#include "main.h"

int main() {
int x = 10;
_printf("%d\n", x);
return 0;
}


The output of the code would be:

10


The following code would print the value of the character variable `c` as a character:

```c
#include "main.h"

int main() {
  char c = 'a';
  _printf("%c\n", c);
  return 0;
}
The output of the code would be:

a
The following code would print the value of the string variable s as a string:

C
#include "main.h"

int main() {
  char *s = "Hello, world!";
  _printf("%s\n", s);
  return 0;
}
